# Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard
Objective

Customer retention is a key challenge for businesses, and understanding churn patterns is crucial for decision-making. To analyze customer churn behavior, I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides deep insights into churn trends


## About the Project
--> This Project was Part of Round 2 of Statisella - Data Analytics Competition hosted by IIT BHU, flagship event of its Bussiness Club.

--> Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze customer churn, visualizing key metrics like churn rate, credit score, and product usage.

--> Integrated multiple filters and advanced visualizations (bar charts, pie charts) to track active customers, complaints, and satisfaction trends.

--> Presented insights via a PPT report, highlighting key drivers of churn and actionable business strategies for retention.
## Dataset
The dataset includes customer information such as credit score, tenure, number of products, balance, complaints, and churn status. It has been cleaned, wrangled, and analyzed to extract meaningful insights.
## Project Report
The full analysis and insights are compiled into a PowerPoint presentation for easy interpretation and decision-making.
